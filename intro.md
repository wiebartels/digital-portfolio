```{tab-item} Things I learned
* How to insert figures and add cross-references to them
* How to set up the components required to build a jupyter book (configuration file, table of content file and book content files)
* How to add directives to the notebook files such as admonitions, and dropdowns


```

```{tab-item} Things I found difficult
* I ran into an issue with the analysis_example notebook automatically using the kernel called “conda-base-py” which resulted in errors when building the notebook.
* I struggled a bit with creating these tabs since I did not correctly enclose them in with the directive wrapper symbols.
